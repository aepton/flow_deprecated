Yet <u>geography has also constrained the freedom of U.S. policy action. Mexico\u2019s position on the U.S. southern border means that the overriding U.S. interest in Mexico is ultimately to have a stable ally on its frontier</u>. The importance of this fact was evident during the early nineteenth century and was forcefully underlined during World War I when Mexican political instability and flirtation with U.S. adversaries created the threat of a possible attack on the United States through Mexican territory. In the aftermath of that war, concerns about foreign adversaries attacking the United States through Mexico declined, but the approach of a second world war rekindled U.S. strategic concerns about Mexico. In this circumstance <u>the United States acquiesced to the 1938 nationalization of the Mexican petroleum industry</u>, a clear violation of the sanctity of private property rights for which the United States had intervened in the past. Put simply, <u>having an ally in such a strategically important country trumped the rights of U.S. property owners</u>. During the Cold War when the United States feared that developing nations might fall like dominos to communist influence, Mexico was the \u201clast domino\u201d in Latin America. <u>This strategic reality motivated a U.S. willingness to accept Mexico\u2019s authoritarian politics and closed economy for forty years</u>, practices that had previously motivated U.S. involvement in Mexican affairs, in exchange for a stable, anti-communist ally to the south <u>. Mexico repeatedly exploited this consequence of geography to carve out an autonomous policy-making space</u>. <u>Throughout the Cold War, this enabled an independent foreign policy that was regularly at odds with U.S. preferences</u>. For a revolutionary regime following increasingly conservative economic and social policies at home, a foreign policy motivated by the revolutionary principles of anti-imperialism, social welfare, and non-intervention was an effective tool for legitimating the regime. This inspired a series of international positions in direct opposition to United States policy. Most notably, Mexico sustained diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union when that was frowned upon in Washington; it recognized the Castro regime in Cuba and persistently opposed its political and economic isolation; it vocally opposed U.S.-sponsored coups and other forms of intervention in Latin America; and it actively supported the 1970s socialist government in Chile. <u>The United States tolerated this opposition with an eye to strengthening a stable, essentially pro-U.S. regime on the U.S. frontier</u>, but only as long as Mexican action did not pose a real obstacle to the U.S. capacity to protect its strategic interests. The lone exception to this Cold War rule occurred during the 1980s in Central America when the United States concluded that Mexican involvement directly impeded the promotion of U.S. strategic aims in the region.

The 502-page report pins the blame for the attack -- which killed 85 and wounded hundreds more in what experts call Latin America's 9/11 -- squarely on the Islamic Republic of Iran. In doing so, it provides a timely reminder that <u>Iran's radical regime is active in the Western Hemisphere and that its presence here is far broader than is commonly understood</u>. Just how much is still a matter of considerable debate. <u>Iran's activities in the Americas have exploded over the past eight years, propelled in large part by the warm personal ties between outgoing Iranian President</u>Mahmoud <u>Ahmadinejad and recently-deceased Venezuelan</u>strongman Hugo <u>Chavez</u>. <u>Using Venezuela as a gateway into the region, Tehran succeeded in forging strategic partnerships with like-minded governments in Bolivia and Ecuador, and expanding its contacts with Peru, Nicaragua and a number of other regional players</u>. Despite these gains, however, some experts still tend to see Iran's efforts as little more than anaxis of annoyance.But Nisman's indictment convincingly says otherwise. Over the past three decades, the Argentine brief alleges, <u>Iran has succeeded in quietly erecting a network of intelligence bases and covert centers</u>that spans no fewer than eight Latin American countries: Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname. <u>This infrastructure was instrumental in allowing Iranian proxies to carry out the AMIA bombing, as well as to plot other attacks</u>(such as an unsuccessful 2007 attempt by Guyanese national Abdul Kadir to blow up fuel tanks at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport). Moreover, Nisman has made clear <u>the network enabling Iran to carry out attacks in the region, or against the United States, isn't simply a relic of history</u>. Rather, there's good reason to believe that <u>it remains both intact and functioning</u>. In fact, <u>it could soon get even bigger</u>. That is <u>because the Latin American region as a whole is in a state of profound political flux.

Next door in Colombia, the government of President Juan Manuel Santos has embarked upon a complicated and controversial peace process with the extremist FARC militia -- one that could result in the FARC gaining significantly in both political relevance and actual power. Even in Nisman's own Argentina, a new and softer attitude toward Iran has begun to take root, manifested in growing bilateral trade ties and talks of atruth commissionto reexamine the AMIA case (and, ostensibly, to rewrite history in Tehran's favor). <u>These developments could provide new opportunities for Iran to expand its regional influence and its strategic capabilities</u>.", "cite_extras": ["[Ilya, vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council; \u201cIran on our back porch: Column,\u201d 6/05,http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/05/argentina-iran-terrorism-column/2389271/]"], "tag": " Iran is using Venezuela to create an intelligence network in Latin America capable of plotting and executing attacks on the United States.

However, since the end of the Cold War, aid has been explicitly provided to promote and support democratic transitions in recipient  countries through such programs as the Support for Eastern European Democracy Act, the Freedom Support Act (Former Soviet Republics), and the \u2018\u2018Democracy and Governance\u2019\u2019 initiative. <u>In these programs, USAID has stressed four goals: the rule of law and human rights, competitive elections and political processes, civil society, and accountable governance</u>. As Finkel, Perez-Linan, Seligson, and Azpuru (2006:26) detail, USAID has allocated increasingly larger amounts to its \u2018\u2018Democracy and Governance\u2019\u2019 initiatives around the world. In constant 1995 dollars, such allocations grew from $121 million to $722 million per year from 1990 to 2003. In 2003, democracy aid amounted to about 9% of USAID assistance. Such aid typically bypasses the more official top-down aid channels to assist groups and implement projects directly or through third parties, including an increasingly broad and active set of international private voluntary organizations (Collins 2009). Naturally,USAID claims success in its  <u>democracy promotion</u> efforts. According to Knack (2004:252), USAID proudly notes that <u>36</u>of the 57 <u>states that successfully democratized</u>between 1980 and 1995 <u>were recipients of USAID assistance</u>. For example, while USAID has sponsored programs in Guatemala off and on for decades, that state gained increased attention following the end of its civil war in 1996. From 1996 to 2000, USAID provided more than $18 million in aid for programs to train civil service officers, strengthen civilian control of government (in particular the military), rebuild the justice system, train an electoral tribunal, develop anti-corruption measures, and promote citizen advocacy and increased electoral participation.

The growth of the Sahara, for instance, took many millenniums; many thousands of years ago, people were slowly nudged out of the inland region of northern Africa and into such great river valleys as the Nile and the Niger. Over time, <u>incremental but prolonged rises in sea levels will also gradually uproot hundreds of millions of people.</u>But sometimes the displacement happens with shocking speed: Just think of the deadly hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which together drove millions of people to suddenly leave Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. As global warming and population growth increase, we could see far deadlier storms than Katrina. In 1991, a cyclone in Bangladesh displaced 2 million people and killed 138,000. All this can lead to warfare when it's time for the displaced to find a new home. For most of human history, they could at least theoretically do so in unclaimed lands tamped down conflict. But today, this reservoir of vacant turf no longer exists, except in the least hospitable parts of the planet. So when the displaced start eyeing currently inhabited areas, expect trouble -- and the bigger the displacement, the bigger the fight.

Two other states with significant ethanol production, Minnesota and Kansas, were also in the bottom fifteen states for unemployment. <u>While it may be true that the Corn Belt region is currently doing well economically</u>(that is, aside from the effects of the drought of 2012), <u>especially relative to other parts of the country, this has not always been the case. During the 1980s, when commodity prices were very low, the Corn Belt region suffered economic stress from sharply reduced farm profits</u>. <u>By providing a certain source of demand for corn, domestic ethanol production sets a floor on the price of corn, preventing this type of regional disaster from repeating</u>. Additionally, the population of the rural Midwest has been declining for years. As President Obama acknowledged in a 2010 speech, <u>in an era of outsourcing and downsizing that began long before the most recent economic recession, the domestic corn-based ethanol industry stands out as one of the few sectors that is bringing jobs to rural America and allowing towns that might otherwise die to survive</u>. For roughly two decades, <u>the domestic ethanol industry has relied on the promise of continued government support in some form in order to expand facilities and ratchet up production</u>. For years policy-makers have promoted the goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, cutting back on fossil fuel usage, and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign countries for its energy needs. Although the degree to which the domestic ethanol industry actually meets these goals is disputed, it does contribute to achieving each goal to some degree. While importing ethanol from Cuban sugarcane would meet the first two national policy goals, it would detract from the third. It would seem perverse for policy-makers to enact policies that would severely damage an industry that helped meet the national policy goals they had espoused, especially after the policy-makers had supported the industry.", "cite_extras": ["[Jonathan, Legal Advisor for Pearlmaker Holsteins, Inc.

Our immigration laws, after all, are made in America. <u>America lives with the open secret that its physical borders are unsecured</u>. <u>In spite of building a</u>seventeen mile, thirty foot <u>wall</u>and the planned addition of another seven hundred miles of  <u>wall</u> along the border with Mexico, <u>illegal crossings remain active</u>. The Department of Homeland Security keeps a record of apprehensions and deaths along the Southern border. Although the numbers have dropped since the United States built a thirty foot  <u>wall</u>, the number of apprehensions and deaths remain high. From 1992 to 2002, <u>the rate of deaths of unauthorized border crossings tripled</u>. <u>Studies by sociologists have concluded that the increased border security does not result in fewer undocumented immigrants in the country</u>. Illegal crossings continue, but they are more costly.  First, counterintuitively, the risk of apprehensions has decreased, but crossings are more physically risky. Second, coyotes can now charge more. In spite of the concrete fences close to settled populations, determined undocumented immigrants can still get through the border - it only takes more attempts to be successful. Even with enhanced security, for the most determined crossing the border, it is simply a matter of time, money, and determination. A LatCrit XI keynote speaker, Dr. Alejandro Portes, has concluded that <u>our borders are unsecurable</u>. Rather, <u>the effect of increased border security is to trap millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States</u>. Because border crossings are so difficult, the customary to and fro migration stream from U.S. jobs to Mexican and Central American homelands has now become costly and risky. <u>Instead of going home during the off season or during economic downturns</u>and returning when job conditions at home demand that earners go abroad to seek a living, <u>undocumented immigrants elect to gamble and stay, hoping that further down the line they can bring their families back into the United States</u>, most likely via an illegal border crossing. The Mexican government recently released a study estimating that up to 150,000 children attempted to cross.the border illegally in 2004. One-third of them were unaccompanied by family members or coyotes, and 60,000 were deported (which means that 90,000 successfully crossed the border illegally). <u>The population of undocumented immigrants has become increasingly composed of families of mixed status, and these families havedug inand become more settled</u>. Americans want the porous Southern border sealed, and they are concerned about the large size of the settled undocumented immigrant population. This heightened anxiety over safety is part of post-9/11 concern in the new era of global terrorism, which is not necessarily bigotry, and is a legitimate concern ofmiddle America.But, <u>anxiety over borders and the size of the undocumented immigrant population has made discussion of immigration issues highly charged</u>. In this atmosphere, the Republican Congress, during the 2005-2006 session, began to discuss immigration reform in what would have been the first serious comprehensive overhaul since the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. Predictably, the reform proposals were harsh. The Republican proposal would have criminalized all of the unauthorized and those who wouldknowingly assistthem. These criminalization provisions cast a wide net. There are not only the more than twelve million unauthorized persons, but there are also their families,", "cite_extras": ["[Sylvia R.

It is society</u>, often through the law, <u>which defines who is an alien, an institutionalizedother,and who is not</u>. <u>It is society through Congress and the courts that determines which rights to afford aliens. There is no inherent requirement</u>, however <u>, that society have a category of aliens at all</u>. <u>We could dole out political rights and obligations depending on residence in the community, which is how the public education</u>and tax <u>systems generally operate in the United States</u>. Indeed, <u>a few have advocated extending the franchise to noncitizen residents of this country,</u>a common practice in a number of states and localities at the beginning of the twentieth century. Many alternatives to the term alien exist, includingperson,immigrant,orundocumented worker.My point in this essay, however, is not to offer an alternative terminology. Rather, my hope is to illustrate how <u>the term alien masks the privilege of citizenship and helps to justify the legal status quo.</u> <u>Similar to the social construction of race, which legitimizes racial subordination, the construction of the alien has justified the fact that our legal system offers noncitizens limited rights</u>. Alien terminology helps rationalize the harsh treatment of persons from other countries. <u>Consider the terms of the public debate</u>. <u>Today's facelessillegal aliensare invading the nation and must be stopped or we shall be destroyed. Such images help animate, invigorate, and reinforce the move to bolster immigration enforcement efforts and seal the borders</u>. <u>The images that alien terminology creates have more far-reaching, often subtle, racial consequences</u>. Federal and state laws regularly, and lawfully, discriminate against aliens. It is sanctioned by the Constitution, which provides, for example, that the President must be anatural born citizen. <u>Under certain circumstances, discrimination against aliens is legally permissible</u>. <u>In contrast, governmental reliance on racial classifications generally are subject to strict scrutiny and ordinarily are unconstitutional</u>. <u>Because a majority of immigrants are people of color</u>, <u>alienage classifications all-too-frequently are employed as a proxy for race. Alienage discrimination,</u>though over inclusive because it includes persons who are not minorities, <u>allows one to disproportionately disadvantage people of color</u>.  California's much-publicized Proposition 187 is an example of this phenomenon at work. Although debate during the tumultuous campaign centered on aliens, specificallyillegal aliens,the Mexican-American leaders in California knew which specific group of aliens at which the measure was truly directed. With that in mind, it is not surprising that[w]hite voters supported the proposition at about a two-to-one ratio while Latinos overwhelmingly opposed it by over a three-to-one margin.My point is that the terminological issue is not simply a word game. <u>Alien terminology serves important legal and social functions</u>. Alexander Bickel perhaps said it best in the context of analyzing citizenship: <u>It has always been easier</u>, it always will be easier, <u>to think of someone as a noncitizen than to decide that he</u> <u>[OR SHE]</u> <u>is a nonperso</u>n ... .In Stephanie Wildman's words, <u>language veils the existence of systems of privilege</u>.'

As this issue goes to press, <u>backlash against immigrants, particularly Latina/oillegals,is on the rise.</u>The latest wave of local anti-immigrant legislation began a year ago, in April 2006, in San Bernardino, California with a ballot initiative aimed to deny employers of unauthorized workers access to city permits, grants, and contracts, as well as allow local police to seize vehicles that were used to pick up day laborers, ban landlords from renting units to undocumented persons, and make English the city's official language. Despite the initiative's failure, other cities across the country began to target undocumented persons with similar tactics. Hazleton, Pennsylvania passed Ordinance 2006-40 titled Illegal Immigration Relief Act Implementation Amendment. The ordinance seeks to sanction businesses and landlords by revoking the business permits, for five years, of anyone who employs anillegal alienand imposes a penalty on landlords renting to the undocumented. Two restraining orders initially blocked the ordinance from taking effect, but the ensuing federal trial concluded in March and a decision has not been issued as this issue goes to press. Even though the ordinance has not taken effect, a number of Hazleton's immigrants have already left town. Across the country, local governments have considered ordinances modeled after Hazleton's. For example, in Pahrump, Nevada, the ordinance local council enacted was so blatantly xenophobic that the city took the unconstitutional position of prohibiting residents from flying flags of foreign countries without also flying the U.S. flag at a higher level.This ordinance was later repealed after a newly-elected city council reconsidered the ordinance unduly divisiveand the local Sherriff publicly announced that he would not enforce the township's ordinance. <u>State legislatures nationwide are considering and passing legislation that is hostile to immigrants, particularly the unauthorized</u>.

Extreme forms of suffering - survival from the Nazi death camps or the Cambodian catastrophe - are not the same as theordinaryexperiences of poverty and illness.", "cite_extras": ["[Dr. Arthur, Esther and Sidney Rabb Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University; Joan, Professor of Mathematics and Coordinator of Activating Learning in the Classroom at Middlesex Community College. \u201cThe Appeal of Experience; The Dismay of Images: Cultural Appropriations of Suffering in Our Times,\u201dDaedalus, v. 125, n.1]"], "tag": " Narratives do not break down racism.

Especially if hostilities continue or their resumption is threatened, all the elements that make a small disaster tractable will be lacking: limited damage, modest casualties, surviving leadership, a diminishing incidence of role conflict (desire to protect one's family rather than to perform emergency work) and large reservoirs of external, easily mobilized skilled workers, material resources, and organizational skills. The massive and simultaneous destruction of economic and human resources would result in an inability to provide immediate and sufficient human and material aid to damaged areas. <u>There will be no time to adapt and to innovate</u>as nations did in World War II (U.S.S.R. as previously cited is an example). More important, the <u>lack of outside aid would create a sense of individual and communal isolation. Aid</u>symbolizes a reconnection with a larger, normal world. This connection helps provide the impetus for rebuilding the damaged society, creating a sense of vitality and competence to dispel the continuing perception of isolation. It also <u>has an important function for binding together society</u>, restating a common thread of hope and shared aspirations that are the essence of national life.

The very short period required to carry out highly destructive nuclear attacks would intensify the emotional impact, particularly those reactions associated with denial of the true extent of the damage or fostering flight from and resistance to reentering damaged areas. Robert J. Lifton, in his study of Hiroshima survivors, described the psychological effect asa sudden and absolute shift from normal existence to an overwhelming encounter with death.The reaction, as reported by a witness to the disaster, Father Siemes:Among the passersby, there are many who are uninjured. In a purposeless, insensate manner, distraught by the magnitude of the disaster, most of them rush by and none conceives the thought of organizing help on his own initiative.

Here are three strategic gains that emerged from the trip: <u>Obama breathed a little life back into an Israeli-Palestinian peace process</u>that had all but expired. He did this largely by the force of his March 21 speech in Israel. What he accomplished was the diplomat\u2019s trick of riding two horses at once: The speech was a love letter to Israel, as one commentator noted, and it was also a passionate evocation of the Palestinians\u2019 plight, and the need to \u201clook at the world through their eyes.\u201d <u>Obama pulled</u>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin <u>Netanyahu toward the U.S. position on military action against Iran.</u>Netanyahu said that \u201cif Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon \u2014 that is, to actually manufacture the weapon \u2014 then . . . it will take them about a year.\u201d He said the United States and Israel share \u201ca common assessment\u201d of Iran. This sounded close to agreement with Obama\u2019s position that the trigger for a military strike would be an Iranian breakout toward a bomb; that\u2019s quite different from the \u201czone of immunity\u201d arguments Netanyahu was making last year, which viewed Iran\u2019s very position of enrichment technology as the threat. <u>These exchanges demonstrated that Obama is stronger politically than he was a year ago and Netanyahu is weaker. The Israeli prime minister is now trying to associate himself with Obama\u2019s Iran policy, rather than pressuring him</u>. Obama brokered an important reconciliation between Netanyahu and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With the region in turmoil, this was a matter of vital national interest for both Israel and Turkey, but it took Obama to provide the personal link that made it happen. This was a payoff for Obama\u2019s cultivation of Erdogan since 2010, and for his \u201creset\u201d with Netanyahu. <u>Syria remains the test of whether Obama can</u>, forgive the term, \u201c <u>lean in\u201d more during his second term</u>. Obama has been slow to see the dangers of U.S. passivity there: For months he let things drift in Syria; the United States had a nominal commitment to strengthening command-and-control within the opposition but no real policy on the ground to accomplish it. <u>Obama is now said to understand the risk that Syria\u2019s sectarian conflict will spread to Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan if the United States doesn\u2019t take stronger action</u>. The White House is eager to work with Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss, the commander of the Free Syrian Army, on training, logistics and other priorities. The administration recognizes that it may need \u201csafe zones,\u201d perhaps protected by air defenses, to train Syrian rebels inside the country rather than in Jordan and Turkey. The president is still said to resist the simple formula of \u201carm the rebels,\u201d but he seems close to partnering with friendly intelligence services in the region on what would be a major covert action program, reminiscent of Afghanistan in the 1980s, with all the attendant risks. In framing this project, he\u2019d be wise to bring in some CIA veterans who have experience running similar programs, pronto. Obama hasn\u2019t had a personality transplant.

It was presented to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in September 2008, when Olmert was in office. Abbas famously never rejected it, but never saidyes.Yet, at a moment when Secretary of State John Kerry is struggling to revive peace talks, <u>Olmert's plan</u> remains the most realistic, one that Kerry should be promoting.

The campaign was about the candidates and their biographies\u2014not about issues. <u>Nothing suggests Congress will be more productive. The House remains virtually unchanged. The Senate will be more divisive still</u>as most remaining moderate Republicans and Democrats resigned or lost their seats. We will know soon whether compromise is possible when the lame-duck Congress returns next week, and begins discussion of the fiscal cliff embroglio. The best guess is that Congress will find a way, not to resolve the problem, but to defer its consequences. The election results focused attention on immigration policy, which both Republicans and Democrats may be motivated to address. President Obama's declared intention to address immigration was surely reinforced by the huge Latino vote. <u>Many of the Republicans who blocked previous immigration initiatives will resist again</u>. But some recognize their party may become irrelevant unless they take seriously the Latino and black constituencies that accounted for more than 40 percent of Obama's total. U.S. immigration reform would be a welcome change in most of Latin America, particularly in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. <u>Obama may seek to pursue further openings to Cuba</u>\u2014 <u>but these will be limited unless the Cuban government shows a willingness to reciprocate with new human rights measures or political changes. Drug policy is not high on the U.S. agenda</u>, but the approval in Colorado and Washington of ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana use may spark wider discussion on drug issues. But Mitt Romney offered the most significant policy proposal for Latin America, when called for more intensive U.S. efforts to pursue multiplying economic opportunities in the region.A: Andr\u00e9s Rozental, member of the Advisor board, president of RozentalAsociados in Mexico City and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution:President Obama's re-election is a welcome development for Latin Americans in general, and Mexicans in particular. Although many of Obama's campaign promises in 2008 relevant to the region remain unrealized, there is a modicum of hope that as a leader in his second term, with more political capital to spend, he can at least make a stronger effort to tackle comprehensive immigration reform and trade issues critical to Latin American prosperity. Although I don't foresee any major change in the United States' foreign policy toward the region, especially as long as <u>Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East remain priorities for Washington</u>, that may not necessarily be a bad thing. We often complain when Washington pays too much attention to us, and equally when there's less overt interest in the region, but I believe that Obama has mostly shown a much more mature attitude toward Latin America over the last four years than has traditionally been the case.", "cite_extras": ["[Peter Hakim, member of the Advisor board and president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue; Andr\u00e9s Rozental, member of the Advisor board, president of RozentalAsociados in Mexico City and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; Rubens Barbosa, former ambassador of Brazil to the United States; Riordan Riott, director of the Latin American Studies program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies; \u201cWhat Will Obama's Second Term Mean for Latin America?\u201d 11/08, http://www.thedialogue.org/page.cfm?pageID=32pubID=3135]"], "tag": " Link: Latin America ranks as a low priority for U.S. foreign policy, and Republicans will battle on every issue.", "hash": "4400ce1a73a369ee5031e7c6dfc802f7", "cite": "LATIN AMERICAN ADVISOR, 12"}, {"text": "President <u>Obama is ready to take one more shot at global warming with the last, least-popular, and messiest tool he\u2019s got left: regulations</u>administered by the politically besieged Environmental Protection Agency. <u>It won\u2019t be popular</u>, it might not work, and it could jeopardize his pick to head EPA. <u>But</u>the reality is that, three years after Congress killed a cap-and-trade bill, <u>Obama is running out of time</u>. <u>If he doesn\u2019t finalize EPA rules controlling greenhouse-gas emissions before he leaves the White House, a Republican president, or a GOP-controlled Senate, could undo the rules</u>\u2014and his environmental legacy. \u201c <u>He is serious about making it a second-term priority</u>,\u201d Heather Zichal, Obama\u2019s top energy and climate adviser, said at an event last week. \u201c <u>He knows this is a legacy issue</u>.\u201d <u>The effort amounts to both a marathon and a sprint, in which Obama must simultaneously navigate political, legal, and policy hurdles that could halt his efforts if he fails to map out a clear way forward</u>.

See http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/  Many <u>scientists view the world's oceans as an important sink for capturing the human-induced greenhouse gas CO2 and slowing global warming</u>. Marine plants soak up CO2 as they breathe it in and convert it to food during photosynthesis. Organisms also use it to make their skeletons and shells, which eventually form sediments. With the explosion of fossil-fuel burning over the past 200 years, it has been estimated that more than a third of the human-originated greenhouse gas has been absorbed by the oceans. While marine organisms need CO2 to survive, work by Caldeira and colleagues shows that <u>too much CO2 in the ocean could lead to ecological disruption and extinctions in the marine environment</u>. <u>When CO2 gas dissolves into the ocean it produces carbonic acid, which is corrosive to shells of marine organisms and can interfere with the oxygen supply</u>. If current trends continue, the scientists believe the acidic water could interrupt the process of shell and coral formation and adversely affect other organisms dependent upon corals and shellfish. <u>The acidity could also negatively impact other calcifying organisms, such as phytoplankton and zooplankton, some of the most important players at the base of the planet's food chain</u>. <u>We can predict the magnitude of the acidification based on the evidence that has been collected from the ocean's surface, the geological and historical record, ocean circulation models, and what's known about ocean chemistry</u>,continued Caldeira.What we can't predict is just what acidic oceans mean to ocean ecology and to Earth's climate.

This week, William Galston and others have raised the question of whether the Obama team lacks focus. Fair enough. But I'd like to tackle another question: <u>Is Capitol Hill even capable of handling so many projects at once? Well, there are certainly reasons to think it isn't.

It has also been a bridge too far for Democrats in the House and Senate to bring some Republicans in at the conception stage of major legislation. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic that <u>this Congress will end up pushing through an historic amount of ambitious legislation over the next two years</u>. One reason is that things are different than they were when Bill Clinton came into office with nearly identical numbers to now--258 Democrats in the House and 57 in the Senate--and had a tough time of it. Back then, Democrats had been in the House majority for 38 consecutive years; they saw themselves as the permanent government, while the president, no matter his party, was an ephemeral figure of little importance to their status. When that theory flamed out with the Gingrich-led landslide in 1994, they had twelve miserable years in the minority to think about it. Now the attitudes are at least a bit different; that is why Democrats hung together on the stimulus despite no Republican support in the House and the bare minimum in the Senate, and got it through only four weeks after the inaugural. Of course, <u>Obama will lose (and already has lost) some of those Democrats, both on the left and among the Blue Dogs--but he will have a real chance down the road of finding some more Republicans, especially in the Senate, to make up the s</u> <u>lack.</u>", "cite_extras": ["[Norman J.

The decline remains slow but consistent, in stark contrast to the rising fortunes of China and even the relatively gentle rise in the Japanese power cycle. It would be a mistake, however, to interpret this decline as evidence of the United States experiencing any significant decline in any specific capabilities. Indeed, between 1981 and 2001 the US saw actual increases in four of the six capability indicators.29 As Doran and Parsons note, it is not enough that a state experiences growth in the assessed capabilities in order to \u2018grow\u2019 their power cycle curve \u2013 the state must also \u2018out-grow\u2019 the rate of change of other states in the system under investigation.30 In effect, a state must be \u2018running to stand still\u2019 else it will face a decline in relative power as the United States has in the period post-1941. These somewhat superficial results, however, should not distract from the more integral and ultimately more significant implication which can be drawn from the power cycle curves of the United States, Japan and China.

In all the above cases, donors need to specify exactly what goals or directions it has in mind for their respective recipients. <u>The possibilities are virtually endless, ranging from fiscal and macro-economic reforms, structural adjustment programmes, respect for human rights, reducing military expenditure, gender and environment-friendly policies, procedural and substantive democracy</u>, <u>to the promotion of free media and stimulation of civil society.</u> <u>Also</u>frequently i <u>ncluded in conditions are anti-corruption policies, transparency and other measures of good governance</u>. It is beyond the scope of this paper to elaborate on the problem of defining these issues in a consistent and appropriate manner, because of the specific context, capabilities and weaknesses of each recipient country. <u>The knowledge base for such policy prescriptions is often weak</u>, as the intervention logic of many policies is not based on location-specific, tested and proven evidence. Stokke makes a number of interesting observations on those issues and also raises also a number of fundamental, moral and ethical dilemmas in this regard (1995: 33-41). 3.2 When does aid or policy become a conditionality? Though we may now all agree that conditionalities are donor instruments or attempts to reach particular goals, the question remains when a particular donor instrument can be called a conditionality and when not? Lewis, for example, defines conditionality as \u2018donor efforts of one kind or another to influence recipient policies\u2019 (1993:41). <u>By this definition, conditionality attaches to virtually all aid and thus the definition loses its distinguishing character.</u>", "cite_extras": ["[Georg, Professor of Conflict Prevention and Conflict Management at Utrecht University; \u201cThe Use of Peace Conditionalities in Conflict and Post-Conflict settings: A Conceptual Framework and a Checklist,\u201d October,www.clingendael.nl/publications/2006/20061000_cru_frerks.pdf]"], "tag": " They do not win Limits because there are no limits to what conditional affirmatives could do.

Even though the objective is to achieve democratization and respect of human rights, the European Union does not commit to a framework in which it will aid the country to reach these objectives.

However, the term itself <u>remains a source of confusion</u>. Except in the few instances where the US has sought to isolate a regime or country, <u>America arguably \u2018engages\u2019 states and actors all the time simply by interacting with them</u>. <u>To be a meaningful subject of analysis, the term \u2018engagement\u2019 must refer to something more specific than a policy of \u2018non-isolation\u2019</u>. As used in this article, <u>\u2018engagement\u2019 refers to a foreign-policy strategy which depends to a significant degree on positive incentives to achieve its objectives</u>. Certainly, it does not preclude the simultaneous use of other foreign-policy instruments such as sanctions or military force: in practice, there is often considerable overlap of strategies, particularly when the termination or lifting of sanctions is used as a positive inducement. Yet <u>the distinguishing feature of American engagement strategies is their reliance on the extension or provision of incentives to shape the behaviour of countries with which the US has important disagreements</u>. Today\u2019s rapidly globalising world, no longer beset by Cold War competitions, creates new possibilities for engagement as a foreign-policy option. In particular, the growing recognition of the drawbacks of punitive policies in this new environment has spurred a search for alternative strategies. There are increasing doubts about the wisdom of using sanctions, particularly when exerted unilaterally in a globalised world economy, to dissuade problem regimes from their agendas. Not only has the record of sanctions in forcing change been poor, but the costs of such policies to civilian populations and American commercial interests has often been substantial. Just as faith in sanctions has been shaken, the limits of military force have been exposed: despite relentless bombings, Saddam Hussein remains in power, and events in Kosovo demonstrate how even the most carefully orchestrated military campaign can result in serious collateral damages. Moreover, the dissolution of Cold War alignments has both opened new opportunities for engagement strategies and created new rationales for them. Due to the heightened economic vulnerability and strategic insecurity of former Soviet allies, the incentives that the US can offer have new potency. At the same time, because America\u2019s allies are freer to shape their foreign-policy agendas subject to their own desires, the US needs to seek out policies with appeal which extends beyond rigid American preferences. During the 1990 s, many of America\u2019s closest allies in Europe revealed a preference for using incentives rather than punitive actions to achieve foreign-policy goals. 2 Many different types of engagement strategies exist, depending on who is engaged, the kind of incentives employed and the sorts of objectives pursued. <u>Engagement may be conditional when it entails a negotiated series of exchanges, such as where the US extends positive inducements for changes undertaken by the target country. Or engagement may be unconditional</u>if it offers modifications in US policy towards a country without the explicit expectation that a reciprocal act will follow. Generally, <u>conditional engagement is geared towards a government; unconditional engagement works with a country\u2019s civil society or private sector in the hopes of promoting forces that will eventually facilitate cooperation</u> <u>.

What these new activists want,</u>therefore, <u>is a community predicated on human solidarity. This sort of community,</u>as Emmanuel Levinas describes <u>, is focused on ethics</u>rather than metaphysics.His point is that <u>establishing order does not require the internalization of a single ideal by all persons, but simply their mutual recognition. The recognition of others as different, but connected to a common fate, is a powerful and unifying principle. Persons are basically united through the recognition and appreciation of their uniqueness.</u>As should be noted, this image is encompassing but not abstract. Uniformity, in other words, is replaced by the juxtaposition of diversity as the cement that binds a community together. Like a montage, a community based on human solidarity is engendered at the boundaries of its various and diverse elements. The genius of this rendition of community is that no one is by nature an outsider, and thus deserving of special treatment. Many of the problems that exist today, in fact, result from persons sitting idly while their neighbors are singled out as different and discriminated against or exploited. When persons view themselves to be fundamentally united, on the other hand, such mistreatment is unlikely, because community members protect and encourage one another. Indeed, this sort of obligation is neither selective nor optional among those who belong to a true community. Basically <u>the idea is that if no one is an outsider, there are no persons or groups to exploit. Such a community, moreover, does not require extraordinary actions on the part of its members to end racism, sexism, or economic exploitation.</u> <u>All that is required is persons refuse to turn away and say nothing when such discrimination is witnessed. By refusing to go along with these practices, any system that survives because of discrimination or exploitation will eventually grind to a halt.</u> <u>Clearly, there is an implicit threat behind current trends of globalization. Because globalization as it is currently defined is inevitable, anyone who expects to be treated as rational and civilized must accept some temporary pain. Old cultural ways will simply have to be abandoned, and a transition to the new economic realities. Those who cannot tolerate the mistreatment of fellow community members any longer appear to be a part of this change, however, they are obligated to bare witness to these abuses.

It is not that Trade Is</u> War entails a literal trade is peace, but that <u>Trade Is War pushes the discourse of trade from</u> <u>a discussion of aggressive trade practices into a discussion of literal war</u>. Brookes nudges the discussion in this direction by mentioning that \u201cMr. Mosbacher [is] emboldened by his success in substantially modifying the FSX agreement (to build a fighter plane with Japan).\u201d Inevitably, it seems, the topic widens to include World War II, with images of Japanese Zeros easily called to mind, and reviving the lingering U.S. fear that Japan cannot be trusted with military power. <u>The discussion of trade war thinly conceals a discussion of actual war\u2014one of the main reasons that Trade Is War is so often ascribed to others</u>, and one of the reasons its mappings are so often attenuated. <u>Trade Is War's push toward the literal is especially evident when the discussion involves Japan</u>. <u>For example</u>, when trade writers describe a dispute involving Canadian and American beers as \u201ca longstanding trade war,\u201d the contiguity of literal war does not show itself (French). Instead the metaphor remaps into a dispute among families: \u201cthe heart of the feud\u201d (French). But literal war with Japan remains easily evoked. In Crossfire's discussion of Super 301 (see chapter 1), John Sununu jabs, \u201cYou keep asking why we don't put the focus on the Japanese. We are putting the focus on Japan. But <u>we also read history. And what happened in the world before World War II is a trade war that cost everybody</u>.\u201d Similarly, Mitsubishi chairman Akio Morita, during an earlier time of trade friction, is quoted, \u201cThings appear to have gotten as bad as they were on the eve of World War II\u201d (Jameson). Sometimes the literalizing maneuver is reversed, going from literal to metaphoric\u2014underscoring the irony of current war metaphors. Sean O'Leary, tongue-in-cheek columnist for Visual Merchandising and Store Design, makes deft use of the Trade Is War metaphor with such locutions as, \u201cThe Japanese citizenry, foot solders of the economic miracle, is getting the imperial shaft at the retail level.\u201d This comes, however, on the heels of a textual progress from literal to metaphoric. The article begins with a discussion of the Japanese Shogunate and moves to a burlesque of Perry's opening of relations: \u201c'Listen,' said Commodore Perry. 'We'd like you to do business with us.' He came back a year later with a larger fleet, to hear the decision.\u201d Next, O'Leary specifies the link between war and trade: \u201cThe rapid growth of Japan's world economic empire rivals the flowering of our own military machine.\u201d Only then does he move to the metaphoric realm of Japanese economic foot soldiers and an American counterinvasion of McDonald's and shopping malls. Finally, Trade Is War comes into intercourse with the literal as the metaphor itself becomes literalized. That is, <u>the metaphor Trade Is War stands side-by-side with the literal notion that trade is war (really). This literalization occurs when people believe that economic warfare is part and parcel of military war. Economic warriors extend the category of war to include acts of economic aggression ranging from predatory pricing to industrial espionage\u2014or sabotage</u>. More typically, <u>the literalization of the metaphor occurs in ascriptions of Trade Is War to others</u>, usually the Japanese. In Rising Sun, Michael Crichton ascribes Trade Is War/trade is peace to the Japanese in order to accuse them of out-of-bounds trade practices. Likewise, and yet more dramatically, Tom Clancy's Debt of Honor casts the Japanese as aggressors who use both military and economic techniques to attack the United States. In Clancy's novel, Japan militarily occupies the American-owned Mariana Islands, while simultaneously sabotaging computer records on Wall Street. Both acts culminate a nefarious investment scheme through which the Japanese undermine the value of American currency. It is perhaps a testimony to the attractiveness of Japan-bashing that Clancy's novel has enjoyed considerable success. But it is also testimony to the deep entrenchment of Trade Is War that it can be literalized as the plot of popular fiction.", "cite_extras": ["[Philip,Associate Professor of English at Northern Illinois University, A War of Words in the Discourse of Trade: The Rhetorical Constitution of Metaphor, p. 58-60]"], "tag": " The un-underlinedparts of this evidence concede that World War II came out of economic collapse and trade pressures.

This empirical evidence again suggests that <u>racism is in the economic interests of capitalists and other rich whites and against the economic interests of poor whites and white workers</u>. However, a full assessment of the importance of racism for capitalism would probably conclude that the primary significance of racism is not strictly economic. The simple economics of racism does not explain why many workers seem to be so vehemently racist, when racism is not in their economic self-interest. In non-economic ways, racism helps to legitimize inequality, alienation, and powerlessness\u2014legitimization that is necessary for the stability of the capitalist system as a whole. For example, many whites believe that welfare payments to blacks are a far more important factor in their taxes than is military spending. Through racism, poor whites come to believe that their poverty is caused by blacks who are willing to take away their jobs, and at lower wages, thus concealing the fact that a substantial amount of income inequality is inevitable in a capitalist society. Racism thus transfers the focus of whites' resentment towards blacks and away from capitalism. Racism also provides some psychological benefits to poor and working-class whites. For example, the opportunity to participate in another's oppression compensates for one's own misery. There is a parallel here to the subjugation of women in the family: after a day of alienating labor, the tired husband can compensate by oppressing his wife.

In this context,  <u>Grandin</u>\u2019s excellent chapter on the economics of the New <u>Imperialism in Latin America deserves special attention</u>. <u>Central to this New Imperialist economics was the imposition of the neoliberal Washington consensus over a continent</u>that as an immediate result experienced what has been called the lost decade of the \u201980s.  <u>Grandin</u>\u2019s contrast between what went on before and after the neoliberal offensive is truly dramatic. Taking Latin America as a whole, between 1947 and 1973 \u2014 the high point of government sponsored developmental strategies \u2014 per capita income rose 73% in real wages. <u>Between 1980 and 1998 \u2014 the high point of neoliberalism \u2014 median per capita income stagnated at zero percent</u>. By the end of the 1960s, 11% of Latin Ameicans were destitute, but by 1996 this proportion had grown to a full third of the population. As of 2005, 221 million lived below the poverty level, an increase of over 20 million in just a decade. (198) As we know, <u>the greatest resistance to the neoliberal offensive has taken place in Latin America, as witnessed in the critical role that the opposition to the privatization of water played in the ongoing upsurge</u>in Bolivia. Whether in Bolivia, Venezuela or elsewhere in Latin America, <u>the story of resistance to neoliberalism and capitalism is far from over</u>. The Meaning of Imperialism Though <u>Grandin</u>is not fully explicit, he <u>tends to refer to U.S. imperialism as the hard-line, military interventionist policy</u>that has characterized administrations such as those of Johnson, Reagan and the younger Bush. <u>Measured by this standard, the non-interventionism of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Good Neighbor policy virtually escapes the imperialist categorization</u>. Indeed,  <u>Grandin</u> sees Roosevelt\u2019s policy, \u201cdespite its many lapses in practice\u201d as containing \u201cnot only tolerance but pragmatic pluralism.\u201d (38) <u>It is true that on the whole the FDR administration stayed away from using the Marines in Latin America.

First, whilst the former dictates only the purity of intentions and pays no attention to consequences, <u>the ethic of responsibility commands acknowledgement of the divergence between intention and result</u>. Its adherent 'does not feel in a position to burden others with the results of his [OR HER] own actions so far as he was able to foresee them; he [OR SHE] will say: these results are ascribed to my action'. Second, <u>the 'ethic of ultimate ends' is incapable of dealing adequately with the moral dilemma presented by the necessity of using evil means to achieve moral ends</u>: Everything that is striven for through political action operating with violent means and following an ethic of responsibility endangers the 'salvation of the soul.' <u>If</u>, however, <u>one chases after the ultimate good in a war of beliefs, following a pure ethic of absolute ends, then the goals may be changed and discredited for generations, because responsibility for consequences is lacking</u>. <u>The 'ethic of responsibility</u>', on the other hand, can accommodate this paradox and limit the employment of such means, because it <u>accepts responsibility for the consequences which they imply</u>. Thus, Weber maintains that only the ethic of responsibility can cope with the 'inner tension' between the 'demon of politics' and 'the god of love'. <u>The realists followed this conception closely in their formulation of a political ethic</u>. This influence is particularly clear in Morgenthau. In terms of the first element of this conception, the rejection of a purely deontological ethic, Morgenthau echoed Weber's formulation, arguing that: the political actor has, beyond the general moral duties, a special moral responsibility to act wisely ... The individual, acting on his own behalf, may act unwisely without moral reproach as long as the consequences of his inexpedient action concern only [HER OR] himself. <u>What is done in the political sphere by its very nature concerns others who must suffer from unwise action</u>. <u>What is here done with good intentions but unwisely and hence with disastrous results is morally defective</u>; for it violates the ethics of responsibility to which all action affecting others, and hence political action par excellence, is subject.  This led Morgenthau to argue, in terms of the concern to reject doctrines which advocate that the end justifies the means, that the impossibility of the logic underlying this doctrine 'leads to the negation of absolute ethical judgements altogether'.", "cite_extras": ["[Alastair, Professor of Politics at U. of Wales-Swansea,Reconstructing Realism, p. 110]"], "tag": " The role of the ballot is to evaluate the consequences of the Plan and the Alternative and determine which saves more lives.

Third, <u>globalization allows nations to acquire wealth through production and trade rather than conquest of territory and resources</u>. Increasingly, wealth is measured in terms of intellectual property, financial assets, and human capital. Those are assets that cannot be seized by armies. If people need resources outside their national borders, say oil or timber or farm products, they can acquire them peacefully by trading away what they can produce best at home. Of course, free trade and globalization do not guarantee peace. Hot-blooded nationalism and ideological fervor can overwhelm cold economic calculations. But deep trade and investment ties among nations make war less attractive. Trade wars in the 1930s deepened the economic depression, exacerbated global tensions, and helped to usher in a world war.

People today work fewer hours and have more money and better health to enjoy their leisure time than their ancestors.  Man\u2019s environmental record is more complex. <u>The early stages of development can indeed cause some environmental deterioration</u>as societies pursue first-order problems affecting human well-being. These include hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy, and lack of education, basic public health services, safe water, sanitation, mobility, and ready sources of energy.  Because <u>greater wealth alleviates these problems</u>while providing basic creature comforts, individuals and societies initially focus on economic development, often neglecting other aspects of environmental quality. <u>In time</u>, however, they recognize that environmental deterioration reduces their quality of life. Accordingly, <u>they put more of their recently acquired wealth and human capital into developing and implementing cleaner technologies</u>. <u>This brings about an environmental transition via the twin forces of economic development and technological progress</u>, which begin to provide solutions to environmental problems instead of creating those problems.  All of which is why we today find that <u>the richest countries are also the cleanest.</u>And while many developing countries have yet to get past the \u201cgreen ceiling,\u201d they are nevertheless ahead of where today\u2019s developed countries used to be when they were equally wealthy. The point of transition fromindustrial periodtoenvironmental consciouscontinues to fall. For example, the US introduced unleaded gasoline only after its GDP per capita exceeded $16,000. India and China did the same before they reached $3,000 per capita. <u>This progress is a testament to the power of globalization and the transfer of ideas and knowledge</u>(that lead is harmful, for example). <u>It's also testament to the importance of trade in transferring technology from developed to developing countries</u>\u2014in this case, the technology needed to remove lead from gasoline.  This hints at the answer to the question of why some parts of the world have been left behind while the rest of the world has thrived. Why have improvements in well-being stalled in areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world? <u>The proximate cause of improvements in well-being is a \u201ccycle of progress\u201d composed of</u>the <u>mutually reinforcing forces of economic development and technological progress</u>. But that cycle itself is propelled by a web of essential institutions, particularly property rights, free markets, and rule of law. Other important institutions would include science- and technology-based problem-solving founded on skepticism and experimentation; receptiveness to new technologies and ideas; and freer trade in goods, services\u2014most importantly in knowledge and ideas.

LatCrit has influenced education scholarship because <u>LatCrit theory provides a useful frame of analysis</u>. <u>It is through knowledge and critique that individuals can come to understand what changes need to be made</u>. Thus, <u>an academic discipline, such as education, could become lessracist,or less biased toward the White racial experience in its assumptions, norms, and established practices</u>. <u>Educators must always be asking whether practices that educators of good faith have established and fashioned generation after generation are racially and culturally biased</u>. In this year's conference, organizers created a LatCrit track for education scholars in which over ten papers were presented. Lindsay Perez Huber and Maria Malagon have memorialized their presentation in the Symposium's contribution, Silenced Struggles: The Experience of Latina and Latino Undocumented College Students in California. The article addresses the challenges that Latina/o students, many of whom are first and second generation students, face in California's K-12 public education system. <u>Latina/o students often leave the school system at critical junctures and fail to realize their dream of an education</u>. Perez Huber and Malagon provide useful documentation of critical transition spots in the educational pipeline and suggest strategies that can positively affect academic success.  Perez Huber and Malagon also document the individual struggles of undocumented students, estimated in California to be between 5000 and 8000, trying to make it through the system. Family support, financial assistance, and a welcoming campus environment are key areas where these students need help. <u>Educators and institutions can, through their actions, communicatesi se puede,</u>(yes we can) as Perez Huber and Malagon demonstrate. The second LatCrit Education symposium contribution, Be Careful What You Ask For: Educacion Para Toda/os, the Perils and the Power, deals with the backlash climate that students experienced at the University of Utah when the Utah legislature was considering whether to charge in-state tuition to undocumented immigrant students. <u>The authors use narrative scholarship to explain how all Latina/o students were racialized during this period</u>. <u>This contribution usefully documents the dynamics of racialization of Latina/o students  through</u>student interactions <u>, debates in public spaces</u>, student newspaper coverage, and classroom settings.

Woods Fund is committed to raising awareness in the philanthropic  <u>community</u> to support this work. The first sentence of our mission statement reads,The Woods Fund of Chicago is a grant-making foundation whose goal is to increase opportunity for less advantaged people and communities in the metropolitan area, including the opportunity to shape decisions affecting them.For over fifteen years, our foundation has made over $45 million dollars in grants to nonprofits in advancing social change through  <u>community</u> organizing and public policy development, and promoting  <u>community</u> building through the arts. Our primary goal of poverty alleviation is achieved through engaging people in civic life, reducing racism and helping advance more effective public policies and other barriers to equal opportunity. Our grant-making portfolio tells the story of an independent foundation that uses its modest resources in the pursuit of social justice and economic fairness. Throughout this journey we have upheld the ever-challenging and central tenant of participatory policy development. This value continues to shape the lens through which we conduct our business and fosters a profound regard for the wisdom of those most directly affected by the issues to inform the decision-making process. We firmly believe such decision-making results in authentically rich solutions of greater relevance and sustainability. <u>Remnants of structural racism permeate every aspect of our society and influence many issues, in particular poverty alleviation</u>, which our foundation attempts to reduce through its grantmaking.

The Woods Fund of Chicago has chosen to employ a racial equity lens and adopt this core principle to help our foundation think more intentionally about addressing inequities both internally, within the communities in which we operate, and beyond. We have grappled with the process to make racial equity a component of our practice. This action is natural evolution of our ongoing leadership, growth and development as a learning foundation.
